# Notetaker with Express

  ## Description
  
  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) <br>
  This assignment was designed to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.<br>

  The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created and I worked to create the back end, connect the two, and then deployed the entire application to Heroku.<br>
